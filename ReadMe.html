ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK:

This is a Playwright-Cucumber framework.
Playwright is a new straightforward automation tool, which finds and uses locators on the page according to actions of the user.
For that purpose, Playwright-CODEGEN is used. In order to start it, apply following code in cmd;
    mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="codegen www.Amazon.de"

SoftAssertions are integrated to the framework, in order to combine more steps in one scenario, which include verification, but does not
create an impediment to following steps in the same scenario.

This framework is also designed to enable PARALLEL testing without failing due to missing or NULL values missing in the memory.
Every THREAD has its own UNIQUE Browser, Page, Array (to save values in memory), SoftAssert etc. objects created in PlaywrightFactory.

ThreadArray (tlArray) helps to put the values in memory and retrieve them later in following steps in scenario.
For this purpose, there are setKeyAndValueInThreadArray(String key, Object value) and
getValueOfKeyFromThreadArray(String key) methods in BrowserUtilities class which includes many reusable methods.

For assertion, use Playwright.softAssert() for verification. If assertion will fail, screenShot will be taken automatically,
saved to the memory automatically just after every softAssertion, since it is triggered in MySoftAssertions class which
@Overrides onAssertionErrorCollected().



IMPORTANT: To execute assertions in a scenario, assertAll() method is needed ONLY ONCE and it is placed in a ready stepDefinition;
       *****Last step of every scenario MUST be "And all softAssertions are executed" as seen in feature files*****
Otherwise, all verifications will be omitted and scenarios will never FAIL!
