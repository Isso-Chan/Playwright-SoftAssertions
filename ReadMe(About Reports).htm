1. Reports are generated in 2 ways;
    a. In TestRunner class
    b. With maven command

2. Before executing tests, type "mvn clean" in cmd (in your project root folder)

3. After executing tests, 2 different reports are generated under "target" folder;
    -HTML reports (
        -Default html reports
        -Failed html report(After executing FailedTestRunner)

    -Allure results (All settings were done according to following video.)
        -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLwMK4D2aPI

        (1) Just type-> "mvn clean test" in the terminal (with cmd, first move to your project folder!)
        (2) Then reports folder will be generated under TARGET root as allure-results
        (3) Go in Target folder in cmd (or in Terminal of IntelliJ)
        (4) Type -> "allure serve allure-results" and click enter (if report displays nothing,
            then type first "scoop install allure", then apply step 3 again)
        (5) Report will be opened in your default browser

            *** To generate html file of allure report:
            -move to target folder (not in allure-results) on CMD prompt
            -type "allure generate"
            -Then "allure-report" will be created inside target folder. This may be uploaded to netlify.com
            to be displayed/stored.

            * To show historical trend in allure report;
            -Copy history folder from "allure-report" folder, which can be created after first execution
              and contains info of previous runs, and paste inside "allure-results" folder, before execution of tests.
